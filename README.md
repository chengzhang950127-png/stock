# quant-system

LLM-augmented multi-strategy quantitative trading system for US and HK
equities. This repository holds the **Phase 0 scaffolding** — directory
structure, shared data contracts, the LLM Gateway abstraction, configuration,
CI plumbing, and dev-environment scaffolding. No strategy logic, real data
sources, or real LLM calls land here; those arrive in subsequent Work
Packages.

> **Important:** four core docs (`architecture.md`, `version-plan.md`,
> `wbs.md`, `review-protocol.md`) live in the project knowledge base and are
> not in this repo yet. See `docs/PROJECT_DOCS_PLACEHOLDER.md` for the drop-in
> instructions before starting any WP review.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Install backend deps (uv-managed)
uv sync --extra dev

# 2. Bring up Postgres
docker compose up -d postgres

# 3. Apply schema
uv run alembic upgrade head

# 4. Run tests + lint + invariant check
make check

# 5. Run the API
make dev          # http://localhost:8000/health
```

Frontend (optional for backend WPs):

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev       # http://localhost:5173
```

## Architectural invariants (must-not-violate)

See `docs/INVARIANTS.md` for the full list. Summary:

1. Decision-path code (strategies, portfolio, regime, allocator) makes **zero
   LLM calls** — those decisions are pure rules.
2. The two AI-permitted modules are the event-driven news parser and the
   assistant narrative generator.
3. Every LLM call routes through `LLMGateway` and supplies a Pydantic
   `response_schema`.
4. Model ids are pinned with dated suffixes (no `latest` aliases).
5. `temperature=0.0` by default.
6. Every `StrategyBase` subclass implements all four abstract methods.
7. Secrets, broker credentials, and personal positions never touch git.

`scripts/verify_invariants.py` enforces these in CI. Run locally with `make verify`.

## Engineering decisions made during Phase 0

| Decision                                      | Choice                            | Reason                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Python package manager                         | `uv`                              | Faster than poetry; lockfile is portable; simpler CI cache.            |
| Alembic initial migration                      | Hand-written, covers every ORM model | Lets later WPs pick up an already-migrated DB without touching schema. |
| Pre-commit hooks                               | Optional (config provided)        | `make check` is the source of truth; hooks just shorten the loop.      |
| Frontend in Phase 0                            | Vite + React 18 + TS + Tailwind shell | Real pages land in WP-4.x — build green-lights everything else.        |
| `Position.quantity` / `Trade.quantity` types   | `Decimal`                         | Fractional shares are first-class on US brokers (IBKR / Schwab / Fidelity). |
| Logging                                        | `structlog`, JSON in non-dev      | Friendlier for downstream observability; matches FastAPI conventions.  |
| LLM provider in dev / V0.1-V0.5                | Mock                              | Keeps decision-path INVARIANTs verifiable without provider keys.       |
| DB driver                                      | `psycopg` (v3) — sync only        | Phase 0 doesn't need async DB; can layer asyncpg later if necessary.   |
| Currency handling                              | `Currency` enum on `Stock` / `Account` / `Position` / `Trade` | Cross-market portfolio MTM and FX accounting need explicit source-of-funds; comments alone are not enough. Added in Phase 0.5 (v1.1 docs). |
| US universe (V0.1)             | Static 100-stock list + 5 core ETFs | Wikipedia/datahub scrape can wait — V0.1 needs a fast, reproducible starting universe. Point-in-time membership is V1.x. |

## Where to look first (recommended review order)

1. `src/contracts.py` — the data shapes every WP depends on.
2. `docs/INVARIANTS.md` — the rules every WP must respect.
3. `src/llm/gateway.py` + `src/llm/mock.py` — how AI calls are gated.
4. `src/strategies/base.py` — the strategy contract.
5. `src/db/models.py` + the initial migration — persistence layout.
6. `scripts/verify_invariants.py` — automated enforcement.

## Known TODOs deferred to later WPs

- A real LLMGateway adapter (LiteLLM-backed) lands in V0.6 (WP-2.4 V0.6 +
  the AI narrative module called out in `version-plan.md` §V0.6).
- DB-backed audit log for LLM calls — currently in-memory ring buffer.
- Real data adapters under `src/data/` (yfinance, Tushare/AKShare for HK) —
  WP-1.x.
- Notification adapters (Telegram / email / WeWork) — WP-4.2.
- Authenticated API and JWT — WP-5.1.
- Frontend pages — WP-4.3 / WP-4.4 / WP-4.5.
